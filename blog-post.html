            <h6>September 23, 2023</h6>

            <p>
              I am a 24 year old girl, who just completed my first half
              marathon! This is a blog about my marathon journey! I was always
              in my head this underweight girl who never had the confidence that
              I can pull off any sport mainly because I believed I wouldn't have
              enough strength, stamina and importantly I thought I would lose
              weight! But here I am today completing 21 kms and only feeling
              stronger!
            </p>

            <p>
              On 24th April I registered for a half marathon, at the time of
              registration I had never run even half a mile! During that time a
              friend of mine, Adithya had recently finished his full
              marathon(42kms) which was truly inspirational for our entire
              group. But being human, do you ever feel motivated to actually go
              out and run and practice for a marathon which is like 6 months
              away?! Come on, not at all! This was my end term month of Spring
              sem and as always I had an excuse for myself that studies are more
              important! So I barely ran 1-2 times before summer started.
            </p>

            <p>
              I moved to Boston for my summer internship. I met my new
              roommates, Monyka and Keisha, in my first week, to have a small
              talk, I had said "I have registered for a half marathon", and
              funnily enough I wasn't aware that both of them were into running.
              I was still not inspired enough, I told Adithya this -- and he
              said this is because you haven't yet experienced runner's high!
              Monyka asked me to join for a run in my first week, that day I ran
              my first 5kms and after that run I actually felt like my legs were
              numb and I was floating -- this is a runner's high. That was the
              best feeling of my life! I had never experienced such a win!
            </p>

            <p>
              Even though maintaining consistency was necessary, it is always
              very easy to give up because every excuse you give to yourself
              feels valid! Then why did I keep on running? Like everyone else,
              my internship period was stressful and lonely. I needed something
              to look forward to for my day. As much as big wins are necessary
              in our lives, but small wins help you survive the day. Running
              helped me maintain my mental sanity, helped me have some personal
              yet achievable milestones for my week. Looking back I feel more
              than for the marathon I ran to survive my weeks peacefully. There
              were days with bad runs as well as good runs! I completed my first
              8k in June and first 10k in July! Along with me 4 of my friends
              had registered. Shreyas was in Florida, Adithya in Seattle,
              Abhipsha in Jersey and Priyesh in Indiana. We used to share our
              runs on Strava which was quite helpful and inspirational!
            </p>

            <p>
              Until the end of August I had never run more than 10k, I worried
              about my cardio since the marathon was just 3 weeks away! Just to
              give myself confidence, I ran my first 15k in the first week of
              September. My knee got injured a bit after that. I was still
              confident that it would recover in 3 weeks, however due to the
              daily commute to college, it just worsened and never really
              recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to the day of the marathon, I had many things in my
              mind, will my knee be able to survive, what if I feel like giving
              up midway, have I eaten enough, what if I feel like using the
              washroom in between the marathon, and importantly will I be able
              to run in rain! But all those thoughts vanished once I reached the
              starting point, the energy was surreal! All people from different
              age groups, everyone was super inspiring. The race began, my knee
              started hurting but my cardio was good, there was a moment where
              there were 2 sign boards one said "take left if you want to do a
              5k marathon" and another said "take right if you want to do 21k
              marathon". At that moment, I felt like this is it, my knee will
              recover but I might never be here again, and I took the right
              turn! Once you cover 5-6kms your whole body becomes numb, you stop
              feeling any pain and even legs. The marathon route was beautiful.
              When I saw the Statue of Liberty on my way I felt like if I had
              taken that left, I would have missed this! Run till 15k was
              smooth, but after 15k body, mind, legs everything starts giving
              up, I felt weak, tired, felt like giving up. But looking at people
              running around, you feel like just some time more. The last 2 kms
              feel like forever, you wish to see the finish line so badly, but
              it just never appears! Finally, I saw a board saying '13 miles'
              done, I was converting in my head how much kms it is? And a middle
              aged uncle came next to me and said you are literally there, do
              not stop now! And that was it, I saw the finish line, I could hear
              my friends shouting my name, and crossing that finish line was one
              of the biggest moments in my life. I am so glad I did not take
              that left!
            </p>
            <p>
              I must admit that I have given up on many things in my life
              before, but this feeling of not actually giving up this time and
              sticking till the end feels amazing! In the end, if someone like
              me can complete a marathon, then I guess anyone can!
